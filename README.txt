When installing the app on a device or emulator,
the Android OS will tell you that the app may be harmful.
This is simply because it doesn't recognize the app's license.
The app is completely safe to install and there is no malware.

Please use the following credentials to test the app with.
This account was created specifically to test the app with
so there is nothing important associated with the email. Please
feel free to use it however you like.

username: javamailtest093@gmail.com
password: REDACTED

Using any other account will not work until "less secure access"
has been enabled in your google account's settings. Otherwise an
error will occur within the app and the app will tell you that you have
entered invalid credentials even though the credentials entered may have
been correct.

After a successful login, an email is sent to the email account above
letting the user know that there has been a new sign in. The device's
model and manufacturer name is given in the email. When sending an email
you are able to send an email to multiple people by separating their emails
by a comma(',') followed by a space(' '). Press the "send" button to send the
email and press the "log out" button to close the app. Use the "remember me"
checkbox to let the app save your username(not the password). Unchecking the
"remember me" checkbox will clear the saved username from the app's storage
